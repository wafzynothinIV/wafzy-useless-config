# About this *(useless)* repository?
Yet Another Useless Confihguration 🥀 (and remember this is kinda weird if you didn't edit after put the new file). (Ignore The Languages).

# some contains of this repo
- fastfetch
- hyprlock

# Before use the *(useless)* files | fastfetch
- **ALWAYS** backup your old fastfetch config
- after you put the new file, maybe you need edit the file for your taste.
> - note: in windows maybe different directory location so you need test with "fastfetch --gen-config" and look the output then put it.

# Before use the *(useless)* files | hyprlock
- same like on the top but your old hyprlock.conf files on the folder "hypr" (maybe.)
- after you put the new file, maybe you need edit the file for your taste.

# how to get this *(useless)* files
